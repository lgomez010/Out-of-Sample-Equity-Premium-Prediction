# Out-of-Sample-Equity-Premium-Prediction
# Extending Rapach et al. (2010): Out-of-Sample Equity Premium Prediction with Forecast Combinations

This repository replicates and extends the seminal paper:

**Rapach, D. E., Strauss, J. K., & Zhou, G. (2010). Out-of-Sample Equity Premium Prediction: Combination Forecasts and Links to the Real Economy. The Review of Financial Studies, 23(2), 821–862.**

The original work demonstrates that simple forecast combinations reliably outperform the historical mean benchmark for monthly U.S. equity premium prediction out-of-sample.

### Project Goal(s)
- **Replication**: Faithful reproduction of core results using the updated Welch-Goyal predictor dataset.
  - Rolling-window and recursive estimation.
  - Individual predictor OLS forecasts.
  - Combination methods: equal-weight, discount mean squared prediction error (DMSPE), trimmed/median variants.
  - Out-of-sample metrics: TBD
- **Extension**: TBD
